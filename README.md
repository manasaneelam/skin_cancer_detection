# skin_cancer_prediction_and_detection_using_deeplearning
An adaptive deep learning method can address the issues related to the present techniques of the conventional skin cancer diagnosis. The traditional techniques to screen skin cancer, such as clinical examination and biopsies, may be time consuming, expensive, and also requiring professional skills. This is especially important when the access to dermatologists and other professionals is restricted. Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are capable of automatically and accurately classifying various forms of skin cancer from dermoscopic images. The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning-based detection method of skin cancer and replace the conventional detection methods for early detection of skin cancer with more accurate, reliable, cheaper, and applicable to all over the globe.
