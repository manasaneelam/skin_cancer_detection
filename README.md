# skin_cancer_prediction_and_detection_using_deeplearning
This project integrates Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), into a web-based application for automated skin cancer detection. The system analyzes dermoscopic images uploaded by users and classifies different types of skin cancer with 95% accuracy, enhancing early diagnosis. The CNN model learns intricate patterns in skin lesions, improving detection efficiency without requiring manual feature extraction. A Django-powered web application provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive real-time predictions. This solution is particularly beneficial in areas with limited access to dermatologists, offering a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective approach to skin cancer diagnosis.
